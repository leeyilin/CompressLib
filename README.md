# CompressLib


## Overview
A library aimed to compress quote data during data transferring from server to client. The compression rate ranges from 80% to 10%.


## Details
1. There are extremely large amounts of quote data generated everyday all over the world and most of the data follows some specific patterns if taking the time axis into account. The core algorithm is implemented under one of the patterns.
2. The implementation of BigInt and BitStream makes the core algorithm plausible.
3. The core algorithm is full of bitwise operatiions.
