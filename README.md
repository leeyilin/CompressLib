# CompressLib


## Overview
	The size of quote data generated every day is extremely enormous and could consume the bandwidth very quickly. By compressing the data transferring from servers to clients with special algorithms, we could relieve the bandwidth, save lots of money and improve the overall performance of the servers. The compression rate ranges from 80% to 10%.


## Details
* There are extremely large amount of quote data generated every day all over the world and most of the data follows some specific patterns if taking the time axis into account. The core algorithm is implemented under one of the patterns.
* The implementation of BigInt and BitStream makes the core algorithm plausible.
* The core algorithm is full of bitwise operatiions.
